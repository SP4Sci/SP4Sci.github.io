We invite authors to submit original research and experience papers relevant to the workshop topics.
Please read the following guidelines carefully before preparing your submission.

### Paper Format

All submissions must use the **official [ACM Primary Article Template (LaTeX)](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)**.
Papers should be formatted in **double-column** layout.

### Review Process

The workshop will use a **single-blind review** process.
Authors should include their names, affiliations, and contact information in the submitted manuscript.

### Page Limit

The maximum paper length is **6 pages**, including figures, tables, and references.
Authors seeking to exceed this limit should **contact the workshop organizers** prior to submission for approval.

### Publication and Open Access

Accepted papers will be published in the **ACM Digital Library** as companion of the Computing Frontiers '26 proceedings.

All papers will be made available under the **Gold Open Access** model.
Please note that an **open access fee** may apply **if the authors' institution does not have an existing ACM Open agreement**.
Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open.
The subsidy will offer:

- **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members**
- **$350 for non-members**

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM.
Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period.
